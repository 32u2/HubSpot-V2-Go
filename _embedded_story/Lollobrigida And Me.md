Lollobrigida And Me

(short story)

I heard this as a joke, not sure how politically correct though, as it in its original incarnation mentioned the name of a real actress. I think it was Michelle Pfeiffer, so the joke can’t be recent either. Also… people embellish verbally told stories over time, sometime offering new details which would make the story appear more "accurate", or more contemporary. That is how, before we know, some really good stories to boot turn into the fuckups of biblical proportions. Or into a witty piece exploiting at least two clichés postmodernism gave us: use of "found material", pastiche of sorts, and self-referentiality.

Because this particular joke is in many ways so particularly crude, I suspect it might have been even older than the Pfeiffer ‘s Eighties. The name Gina Lollobrigida comes to mind. It connects nicely with what we today remember as the very crude McCarthy Era. The name may mean nothing to today's hipsters and trannies, but fuckem if they're not interested where their parents' generation is coming from. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Lollobrigida). 

This is what I found in one thread, while doing research for this piece:

“I love Gina, she's a ballsy broad, fucked Warren Beatty in front of a crowd of people in Cannes in '67.”

So I’ll swap them, the two divas, without a qualm - an example of an unhinged phantasy that, paradoxically, brings us closer to the possible realities, while we search for the postmodern truth whose requirement is not to be true, but to merely offer a vaguely coherent, yet titillating plot.

This travelling salesman loved his job so much that he saved some money and decided to fly to a short, but classy and expensive holiday. Alas, there was some turbulence in the mid-air, one engine jammed, the pilot panicked and the only two survivors landing on this desolated island were our salesman and a Hollywood beauty at her prime – Gina.

They tracked down and circled back the full Robinson Crusoe cliché. After few years they reused every bit of the aircraft wreckage and acquainted themselves with wardrobe of more than 100 people they never met… They built the house, had a child and a cooked meal every day.

But that one Sunday many years later, while our salesman was lying in the bed and scratching his balls out of boredom and Gina walked around bare breasted, he arrived at an idea.

“Gina!”, he called.

“What’s up, sexy?”, she replied.

“You know that captain’s Samsonite? Do you remember where did we put it? I’d really like to see you wearing his jacket with nothing underneath.”

Gina obliged.

“And you’re still good with the mascara supplies? Do me a favour, bring some mascara and come stand right here in front my bed.”

“No, no, not for the eyes. Won’t you draw a moustache above your lovely upper lip, my dear?”

Gina obliged yet again. It was an island, after all, rich in spices of any kind.

Our salesman spent few moments in deep contemplation, then told Gina not to move, got up from the bed, approached her from the back and whispered in her ear:

“Listen pal, I had an awesome career in sales. I was coining it. Then I took a holiday, the shit happened and here I am. Now, I know there’s a lot of prejudice harboured around about sales people, so you won’t maybe believe me… but the only two survivors were Lollobrigida and me and by now I’m bored of fucking her. She’s, like, my wife for all intents and purposes, get it?”

Then our salesman went back to the bed, connected again with his balls and, after some more contemplation, concluded:

“Much, much better than the Man Friday we did last Sunday.”
